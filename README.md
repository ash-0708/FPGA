# FPGA
This project implements a Virtual FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) environment powered by a JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler backend. It simulates key hardware components like LUTs, Flip-Flops, and Registers, while integrating LLVM-based JIT compilation for runtime execution of hardware logic described in a high-level language.
